## Overview

This handbook is an accumulation of AI Singapore’s Innovation and Platforms Engineering team's experience in delivering more than 40 AI Minimum Viable products (MVP) under the [100E](https://www.aisingapore.org/innovation/100e) programme over the last 5 years.  It is an edited volume containing individual original articles written by our AI Engineers, themed around common topics encountered over a typical AI development lifecycle.

We envisioned this handbook as a useful guide for new AI Engineers joining AI Singapore and to quickly come up to speed on how we execute AI projects. However, the information contained here would also appeal to any new AI Engineers and Managers deploying their first AI project into production.

## How to use this book

The AI Practitioner Handbook is designed to cater to different reading styles. When read end-to-end, the chapters will cover the typical AI project lifecycle, providing a comprehensive understanding of the entire process. Alternatively, book sections can be read in a standalone manner. Each section is written in a question-and-answer format, making it easy to find relevant information quickly.

The AI Practitioner Handbook complements other resources by focusing on the practical aspects of delivering AI projects. To get the most out of this book, use it alongside resources that cover AI algorithms, techniques, and research that further build upon your AI fundamentals. By doing so, you’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of AI project execution.
